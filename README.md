## Practise English

This is a project to test SpeechRecognition API of some browsers. At the momment only works properly on Chrome.

For test that API I create this application that shows a word in screen and you have to repeat that word on the microphone, then the app says if the answer is correct or not.

### Run the project

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
